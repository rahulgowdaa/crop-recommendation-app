# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

This is a modern, animated, and interactive web application built with Flask that helps predict the best crop to grow based on various environmental features like soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It uses multiple machine learning models and provides an insights dashboard with interactive charts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Predict crop using models like KNN, SVM (Linear, RBF, Poly), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- 📊 View accuracy and confusion matrix for each model.
- 🌱 Visualize data distributions and relationships (violin plots, bubble charts, heatmaps).
- 🧠 Crop insights with images and reasons for prediction.
- ✨ Futuristic UI with TailwindCSS and Animate.css.
